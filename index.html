                                            Way back in 2000, my father was a Taxidermist in a tiny town called West, TX. He noticed that it was very difficult to find a vendor for name placards. He bought an engraving machine and asked his computer nerd son (that'd be me) to figure out how to run the machine. We expanded to other things like plaques and trophies over time and in 2001 decided to commit to an awards company called Awards For Excellence.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The business was always a side gig for the family. For having zero marketing, we had a steady flow of business by word-of-mouth. We went to an Awards and Recognition convention to see what the industry was up to. I was around 13 at the time and really thought having a laser engraver would be a game-changer. I wrote a 12-page business plan and presented it to my parents. Dad was skeptical, the machine was extremely expensive, but he figured if I went through the effort of figuring out what a business plan was, then writing one so long he probably fell asleep reading it, he was ok putting enough faith in us to pull the trigger on the purchase.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The laser came and we quickly got it set up and running. It was a blast, such an amazing tool. We eventually changed the name of the company to LNG Laserworks (Lydia-N-Gary) to paint ourselves as a more capable operation. We continued to create awards but we expanded to gifts, personalization, etc. We kept this side-business up for over 20 years!
                                        </p>

                                            Over the past couple of years, my parents grew less interested in owning the business. My wife, Kaitlin, and I were the only two really running the machines up to this point, Dad was working on his career and gunning for retirement and Mom's main contribution to the business was relating to accounting, which she wasn't too fond of. They offered the business to us several times and wanted us to make it grow into our own idea of what our business could be. We discussed it for years and in 2022, we decided that we would take the plunge and take control of the business starting in 2023.

                                            MooLou is a portmanteau of "Maddie-Moo" and "Emmy-Lou", which were pet-names my mother used for my two baby daughters. For us, it represents family and togetherness.

                                            We're kicking off the new year with a renewed respect for the things my parents did for this business over the years. Running a business is tough work! As we continue to nurture and grow our new/old venture, we intend to expand our capabilities beyond what we are currently able to offer. We've already begun purchasing new equipment that will open new doors for us. We're taking each day one at a time and we're not looking to rush to the top but we're excited about where we are and where we're going.
